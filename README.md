# RayVeal
My own version of RevealJS. Based on the awesome [Reveal JS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

- [Demo](http://raybo.org/rayveal)

## Installation
Pretty much like installing RevealJS.

```sh
$ git clone this repository
$ npm install
```

The `docs` folder has everything you'd need to upload to a server to get the slideshow working.

The slide content is in the `slides` folder in markdown format. You can add as many markdown files as you want. There are custom styles for tables, code, etc.


## Preview slides locally

When you're ready to preview the slides

```sh
$ grunt serve
```
